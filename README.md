# Data Science Seminar 2021 

Students, welcome aboard! We will be using this repository to share your projects amongst ourselves and with our collaborators.  If you have not done so already, please take a minute and create a directory with your team name on it.  This will be the location for you to send in your checkpoints as we progress through them this quarter.
