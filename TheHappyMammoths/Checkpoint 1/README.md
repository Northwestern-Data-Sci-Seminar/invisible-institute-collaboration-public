# Checkpoint 1



1. What is the correlation factor between the number of years in the force of an officer and the number of unsustained allegations that a police officer has? 

```
SELECT id, appointed_date,resignation_date, unsustained_count
from data_officer
```

We are getting the correlation factor and we are using the current date of the active officer - the appointed date and then we made the unsustainted_count 0 counts null. We did this amongst all active officers:
```
SELECT CORR(diff, usc) FROM (
SELECT (CURRENT_DATE::date - appointed_date::date)/365 AS DIFF, COALESCE(unsustained_count, 0) as usc
FROM data_officer
WHERE active = 'Yes') as temp;

```



2. What is the average number of times a frequently accused police officer changes the police department unit to another district?

```
CREATE TABLE unit_changes3 AS
    SELECT count(data_officerhistory.unit_id) as unit_count, data_officerhistory.officer_id,
            sum(data_officer.unsustained_count) as sum_allegations
    FROM data_officerhistory, data_officer
    WHERE data_officerhistory.id = data_officer.id
    GROUP BY officer_id;
```

Then execute this code to find number of allegations on the 75 percentile:
```
SELECT DISTINCT
    PERCENTILE_Cont(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY sum_allegations)
FROM unit_changes3;
```

Then execute this code to find the average of transitions from unit for the 75 percentile with more allegations:
```
SELECT
    AVG(unit_count) FROM unit_changes3 WHERE sum_allegations >= 16;
```

Then execute this code to find number of allegations on the 50 percentile:
```
SELECT DISTINCT
    PERCENTILE_Cont(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY sum_allegations)
FROM unit_changes3;
```

Then execute this code to find the average of transitions from unit between 50 and 75 percentile with more allegations:
```
SELECT
    AVG(unit_count) FROM unit_changes3 WHERE sum_allegations >= 6 and sum_allegations < 16;
```


3. Which are the top 5 neighborhoods with the most number of civilian complaints that have been unsustained? What percentage of unsustained complaints have each one from the total?

First we execute this query to find the total count of complaints derived from the next query:
```
SELECT sum(sub.normalised_count)
FROM(
SELECT capita.area_id, complaintcount*1000/capitacount as normalised_count
FROM (SELECT sum(d.count) as capitacount, area_id
FROM data_racepopulation as d
group by d.area_id) capita
JOIN (SELECT area_id, count(data_officerallegation.allegation_id) as complaintcount
FROM data_officerallegation
JOIN (SELECT d1.allegation_id, d1.area_id
FROM data_allegation_areas AS d1
JOIN data_allegation AS d2
ON d2.crid = d1.allegation_id
where d2.is_officer_complaint = 'FALSE') civilian_complaints
ON civilian_complaints.allegation_id = data_officerallegation.allegation_id
WHERE final_finding = 'UN' OR final_finding = 'EX' OR final_finding = 'NS'
GROUP BY area_id) complaints
ON capita.area_id = complaints.area_id
ORDER BY (complaintcount*1000/capitacount) DESC) as sub --6655
```

Then we calculate the weight of each area to see which ones concentrate the most unsustained allegations:
```
SELECT sub.normalised_count/66.55 --this is the total count of the column derived in the above query
FROM(
SELECT capita.area_id, complaintcount*1000/capitacount as normalised_count
FROM (SELECT sum(d.count) as capitacount, area_id
FROM data_racepopulation as d
group by d.area_id) capita
JOIN (SELECT area_id, count(data_officerallegation.allegation_id) as complaintcount
FROM data_officerallegation
JOIN (SELECT d1.allegation_id, d1.area_id
FROM data_allegation_areas AS d1
JOIN data_allegation AS d2
ON d2.crid = d1.allegation_id
where d2.is_officer_complaint = 'FALSE') civilian_complaints
ON civilian_complaints.allegation_id = data_officerallegation.allegation_id
WHERE final_finding = 'UN' OR final_finding = 'EX' OR final_finding = 'NS'
GROUP BY area_id) complaints
ON capita.area_id = complaints.area_id
ORDER BY (complaintcount*1000/capitacount) DESC) as sub
```

4. What is the correlation between the number of unsustained allegations against a police officer and the number of awards that officer has? 

```
SELECT CORR(SUB.T,SUB.A)
FROM
(SELECT count(tracking_no) as t, count(allegation_id) as a, data_officerallegation.officer_id
FROM data_officerallegation
JOIN data_award
ON data_award.officer_id = data_officerallegation.officer_id
WHERE final_finding = 'UN' OR final_finding = 'EX' OR final_finding = 'NS'
GROUP BY data_officerallegation.officer_id) AS SUB
```

5. What is the average percentage of civilian and officer unsustained allegations an officer has?

```
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN final_finding<>'SU' and is_officer_complaint = false THEN 1 ELSE 0 END):: float/SUM(CASE WHEN is_officer_complaint= true or is_officer_complaint= false THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)  percent_unsustained_civilian,
    SUM(CASE WHEN final_finding<>'SU' and is_officer_complaint = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END):: float/SUM(CASE WHEN is_officer_complaint= true or is_officer_complaint= false THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)  percent_unsustained_officer
FROM data_allegation JOIN data_officerallegation d on data_allegation.crid = d.allegation_id;
```
